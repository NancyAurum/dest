These hints apply to each of your leaders: 1. Mines are a good source of gold, but eventually they run dry.  Place farms and income-producing buildings to make additional money.  2. Build and upgrade vaults to provide enough storage for gold.  3. Build marketplaces.  Each one allows access to 10% of the common fund.  4. Farm income drops to 25% of normal during winter.  Prepare for this.  5. Don't place expensive-to-run buildings too quickly.  They may drain a leader's money.  If there is no gold to maintain a building, it will deteriorate.
