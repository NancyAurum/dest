Here are a few gameplay hints: 1. Use the shovel cursor to click on terrain to start construction.  Mine rocks; claim or chop down trees; fill in swamps.  2. Housing and food are most important to your people.  In "peaceful" they will build their own houses (but not in "aggressive" or "hostile"), but it's up to you to start them on farms.  3. Use the eye cursor to click on people; they will tell you how they're doing.  4. After you click on someone, use the leader button.  Watch housing, food, income, and population to gauge how well you are doing.
