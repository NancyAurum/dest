Prepare for winter!  Farm income and food production drop to 25% of normal.  Survival guide: 1. Watch the season hourglass.  It records the passage of time, helping you estimate the duration of winter.  2. Make sure you have enough non-farm income or stored gold to support your city during winter.  3. Keep an eye on "food storage" and "food stored" for each leader.  During the year, surplus food is stored in houses, keeps, and granaries.  Your people can survive on stored food when production drops below demand.
