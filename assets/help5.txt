The more food, housing, and money your people have, the more popular you will be with them.  Near the middle of the Baron's leader screen is a popularity chart.  "Current" shows your popularity and city size at the moment.  "To promote" indicates your goal in each of these areas.  When you exceed both goals, you will be promoted.  Note: to go directly to a leader screen (without clicking on a person first), click on a leader's name (near one of the small pyramids).  The Baron's name is the one near the topmost pyramid.
