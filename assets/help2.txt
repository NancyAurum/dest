As your people push out into the lands near their castles, their needs will increase.  They'll require more food and housing to be happy and to continue city growth.  Expansion will stop if people go hungry or if they run out of housing.  Two things to do:  1. Use the eye cursor to click on people.  Pay close attention to their comments and complaints, so that you can keep them happy.  2. View the data on the leader screens often.  Additional people will join your stronghold only if both housing and food production exceed population.
