This is a FAQ about the strategy/rpg game called STRONGHOLD. This should help
you beat this game a lot better now. Hope this helps you out.

By CooperTeam

VERSION 2.1 - JULY 22, 1998


1.) HOW DO I USE THE PYRAMID?
=============================
The pyramid is used to control how fast or how much effort you want something 
to be done for a particular area. If you have all RED, then you would be 
BUILDING things faster than normal, if you have all ORANGE, you would be 
TRAINING and getting experience for your characters faster, if you have it all 
YELLOW, then you would be recuiting so you can have people join each character 
in the game. Keep in mind that what ever pyramid you use, it will only effect
the area you used the pryamid on, not just for ALL characters. Remember, you
have to click on the proper characters pyramid for that character you want to
effect. (Example = click on the elves pyramid to adjust the elves efforts for
that area.)


2.) OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT MOVING PEOPLE AROUND?
==============================================
Well, see that PINK bar just below the pyramid, that is what's called the
MAGNET bar. In order to move charatcers around you must have your characters
either READY or UNASSIGNED. Next, go to an area that you want to put that
character in to. Then, click on the PYRAMID part of the race you made ready
and click on his race pyramid. Now, click on the PINK bar to set it so you
move only that character you have READY or UNASSIGNED. One thing to remember
is that the ones who are READY will come first and have higher priority over
the UNASSIGNED ones. Still confused? Here is an example of how to move an elf
character to an area you want...

a.) First, find a character you want to move, it can be anyone you want.
b.) Click on a character (ELF) you want to move and set him/her for READY.
c.) Then, choose an area you want that character you go to.
d.) Now, look on the side of the screen for that character race pyramid.
e.) Click on that characters pyramid (ELF) so you have the pyramid on top.
f.) Click on the PINK bar until it says you are moving a character here.
g.) Now, let some time pass by until he gets there. 
h.) Click on the newly arrived character and set it to HOME so he stays there.
i.) Repeat until you are happy with what you got.

Please remember that each race has it's own pyramid, so remember to click on
THAT RACES PYRAMID TO MOVE THAT RACE OR CHARACTER ONLY. That is the reason for 
the (ELF) statement in the example. Also remember that you can move more than
one unit to one area by making more characters READY and then setting the
MAGNET bar to how many you had ready. Remember one thing though, any units
that are UNASSIGNED will start to move to that area if you have no READY units
avaliable to move, or if you set the bar to move more than what you have READY
to move. You will know who's pyramid is who's from the capital LETTER after 
the names of the leaders. The letters are as follows...

C = Cleric race
D = Dwarf race
E = Elf race
F = Fighter race
H = Hobit or Halfling race
M = Mage race
T = Thief race


3.) IS IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD THINGS FASTER?
==========================================
Yes, all you need to do is move characters to that area you want to build
faster and make sure you properly set the pyramid for that race to 100% build.
The more you have characters in a specific area, the faster it will be built.
IT IS BEST TO HAVE IT'S OWN RACE BUILDING IT'S OWN STUFF IN AN AREA! The best
and fair amount of people to have building something is 5-7 people. This many
will build things at a pretty fair speed, even if they are BIG buildings. And
as mentioned, make sure you set the pyramid to 100% build. When you are done
building what ever it is, you can then set the pyramid to what ever you need
to do, and at least make sure you don't have ANY red parts showing on the
pyramid.


4.) HOW COME THE ENEMIES DON'T ATTACK ME?
=========================================
Good question. To tell you the truth, I don't really know, but I do know that
if you attack them first, they will start to come after you. And if you are
trying to destroy the their stronghold, then they will keep attacking you. But
if you do destroy the enemy stronghold, and there were some enemies left, then
they will ALL start to attack you. Although, they will not go to attack your
party, the enemies will go attack YOUR STRONGHOLD, so make sure you are ready
for this. Also remember to have MORE THAN ONE attacking a creature. If you
are up against a lot (like 10-15) then start moving characters into that area
where they are attacking you. Also remember that each enemy has it's own
strengths and weaknesses, so pay close attention on how they die quickly or
slowly. If you want a better explanation, think of most of the enemies as
bees, you don't bother them, they won't bother you.


5.) HOW COME I CAN'T BUILD SOME STUFF EARLY IN THE GAME?
========================================================
That's due to your BARON, your STRONGHOLD leader. You see, you have to aquire
a certain status or RANK if you want to build more stuff like INNS, ARENAS, 
OUTPOSTS, BAZAARS, and more. When you get the rank of ARCHDUKE or ARCHDUCHESS, 
you can build ALL this stuff.


6.) HOW COME I CAN'T BUILD SOMETHING WITHOUT A CHARCTER BEING THERE?
====================================================================
The reason for thst is because the characters you create act as guards or
defence for the city. If you want to build in a new region, you have to move
a character to that region so you have some protection for your buildings.


6.) WHO IS THE BARON?
=====================
You, the player are considered the BARON. You play as the STRONGHOLD leader
and you also control the other 4 castles in the game. Your job, as BARON, is
to help build a large kingdom for the STRONGHOLD, and to protect your
STRONGHOLD from being destroyed by the enemy. It will also depend on if you
chose to be a LAWFUL, NEUTRAL, or CHOTIC leader. Here are the missions for
the 3 types...

LAWFUL  = Just gain the status EMPEROR/EMPRESS.
NEUTRAL = Become EMPEROR/EMPRESS and destroy all the enemy strongholds
CHOATIC = Just destroy all the enemy strongholds


7.) WHAT IS THE STRONGHOLD?
===========================
The STRONGHOLD is the first castle you built when you were starting a new
game. It's the BIGGEST castle in the game. This STRONGHOLD is what is keeping
you alive, once your STRONGHOLD is destroyed, the game is over.


8.) CAN I BUILD OTHER CASTLES?
==============================
Yes, remember that when you start a new game, and you are choosing characters
to place where you want, you can have 4 more additional castles. These other
castles in the game are not that important. They are just there to help you
defend the STRONGHOLD. Remember that your main goal is to DEFEND your main
STRONGHOLD, and complete certain tasks set for the type of BARON you have.
If you have a LAWFUL BARON, then all you have to do is aquire the EMPEROR or
EMPERESS status, if you have a NUETRAL BARON, then you have to become EMPEROR
or EMPERESS and kill all the enemies, if you have a CHAOTIC BARON, then you
have to kill all the enemies. Keep in mind of course that you can play with
just the STRONGHOLD and beat the game, the other 4 castles are there just to
help you defend the STRONGHOLD.


9.) SO HOW DO I BUILD STATUS?
=============================
First, click on the very top name on the right side of the screen. The top
name is always the BARON leader. DO NOT CLICK ON THE PYRAMID, THAT IS USED
DIFFERENTLY, JUST THE NAME. When you do, you will get a statistics look at
your leader or BARON. You will know you are looking at the BARON if you see a
percentage part of the statistics screen. This percentage tells you 2 things.
The first or top one tells you your current status for right now, the bottom
one tells you how much you need to have in order to gain next level of status.
Over on the right side of the percentage are points for area owned. As before,
the top one tells your current area owned, the bottom one tells how much you
need in order to gain next status. When BOTH points and percentage have been
met, that is when you will gain next status. None of the other character names
will have this part of the statistical screen, only the TOP name will. The
others just have the regular info about food, population, and income. Another
way to build status is to...

a.) Destroy the FIRST low intellegent enemy stronghold
b.) Destroy the FIRST medium intellegent enemy stronghold

Only attack or destroy an enemy stronghold if you have a good size army of 
characters and they are at high enough levels to do so.


10.) YOU MEAN THE CHARACTERS I GET CAN GAIN EXPERIENCE?
=======================================================
Yes, when in a certain area, you are done building stuff, change the pyramid
for that character and set it to 100% TRAIN (ALL ORANGE). This will increase
their experience and help them build levels for that area only. If you want
other areas to gain more experience, you have to set that areas pyramid to
all orange for that area. You can also attack enemies at anytime to help build
experience to.


11.) MY CHARACTERS CAN BUILD LEVELS TOO, LIKE IN RPG'S?
=======================================================
Yes, just like all the D&D and AD&D games, all characters can build experience
levels. To see what level a character is, just use your mouse to click on any
character you want to see. When the screen comes up, his experience level will
be in the upper-right hand side of his picture. It will have a slash "/"
separating the 2 sets of numbers. The numbers on the LEFT of the slash is the
characters current experience level, the numbers on the RIGHT of the slash is 
the number that character must reach in order to gain next experience level.
Remember, this game is an OFFICIAL D&D game.


12.) OKAY, SO WHAT KINDS OF ENEMIES WILL I RUN INTO?
====================================================
You will run into lots, but you only get a limited amount of enemies, it is
impossible to have ALL enemies in one game. Although, the enemies you fight
will be chosen at random.


13.) CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME ENEMIES I MIGHT MEET?
================================================================
Well, how about MEDUSA'S, ORCS, SKELETONS, KOBOLDS, GIANT ANTS, GIANT FROGS,
GIANT SCORPIONS, TROLLS, GOBLINS, HOBGOBLINS, and many more.


14.) WHAT IS THE MOST POWERFUL ENEMY I WILL POSSIBLY FIND?
==========================================================
That would be the RED DRAGONS. Although not really the toughest, they have the
best armor class of ANY enemy. Their armor class is -1, so be ready for them.
The reason why they are not so powerful is because they have a limited attack
range, so they can be easy to take out, with a good size army, but they can do
lots of damage, so be ready for them. If you want to know who is the most
annoying, that would be the BLUE DRAGONS, they have a much stronger attack and
they can breathe electricity. They can fire it at a good range, away from the
attacking armies you send, so make sure you have a good army ready for these
creatures. Although there is one more creature that is very deadly to fight as
well as having a good armor factor, the MANSCORPION's are a tough enemy to
face.


15.) OKAY, THEN WHAT IS THE WEAKEST ENEMY?
==========================================
Well, although very annoying, that would have to be the BLAST SPORES. They
only have 1 hit point and 1-3 good hits will kill these things in no time. The
reason why they can be annoying is because when you kill them, they explode,
doing more damage to you, so make sure you are ready for that. Also, these
creatures can poison your characters if they get too close to a character.
When a character gets poisoned, you need to take them to a temple, or you need
to get them to the closest cleric in the game, if they don't reach either one,
poisoned characters die and the dead characters will spawn new BLAST SPORES.
Please be very aware of this. If you want something with less hassle, then
that would have to be GOBLINS, they only have 4 hit points, and can be taken
out with little trouble. They have no special attack, they only use swords and
they have a very low defense. One other creature that is just as weak as
GOBLINS is the KOBALDS.


16.) OKAY, SO IF THERE ARE ENEMIES, THEN THERE HAS TO BE AN ENEMY "BARON"?
==========================================================================
Yes, there is, but you only fight him if you chose the AGRESSIVE or HOSTILE
difficulty when starting a new game. His name is MINDARK, and he is after you
and wants to control ALL of the land for himself. In other words, get your 
characters at high levels and then get ready to attack this guy. You see, when 
he gets his STRONGHOLD up, he is able to build ALL types of enemies, like 
skeletons, orcs, and evil versions of fighters, thieves, mages, and clerics. 
If you do see his STRONGHOLD somewhere on your map, get rid of it A.S.A.P. The
only thing is, you will not see him right away if you did chose the AGRESSIVE
or HOSTILE difficulty. His STRONGHOLD will only appear when you have destroyed
the FIRST SET of enemies that were given to you. After you have destroyed the
FIRST SET of enemies, then his STRONGHOLD will appear somewhere on the map.


17.) OKAY, ABOUT MY CHARACTERS, WHO IS BEST AT DOING WHAT?
==========================================================
Well, you are correct if you think that some of the characters you choose will
have an UP side, and/or a DOWN side. Each character you have in the game will
be good in some stuff, but bad in others, but some have a lot of very good
abilities, others have, what I consider, not very useful abilities. Here is
a list of what each character is good at if you choose to have that race on
your side...

CLERICS  = Don't really have much in building skills, but they make excellent
fighters. They can cast healing spells, and a few offensive spells.

DWARVES  = Best at mining, if you see a rock, have a DWARF mine it, if you 
have one. DWARVES are also very skilled fighters.

ELVES    = Best at getting the most out of trees. They are best at harvesting
trees. Also, they make good fighters, can use bows and arrows, and can cast
some offensive spells. Not only that, they suffer less damage when up against
ANY DRAGON.

FIGHTERS = They don't have much skills in harvesting, or anything, but they
are GREAT in combat. They are the best when it comes to combatting monsters.
FIGHTERS can create swordsmen and archers.

HOBITS   = Also known as HALFLINGS, they have the skills of a thief and elf.
They are great at harvesting crops, forests, and are great in combat. They
also only suffer smaller damage from ANY DRAGON. And, like thieves, they can
see more stuff on the map.

MAGES    = They don't have much skill in building stuff, but they have the
best magic abilities in the game.

THIEVES  = Again, no skill in building stuff, but they can make mirrors to
fight off MEDUSA. Once a THIEF has a mirror equiped, they are immune to the 
deadly gaze of the MEDUSA. They can also see farther on the map than any other 
characters in the game.


18.) SO WHO ARE THE BEST CHARACTERS TO GET AND WHY?
===================================================
Well, if you are a first timer, then the best characters to start out with are
as follows...

STRONGHOLD LEADER    = Elf
First Castle Leader  = Cleric
Second Castle Leader = Mage
Third Castle Leader  = Fighter
Fourth Castle Leader = Thief

Keep in mind of course, that if you choose the FIRST CITY option when you
start a new game, you are given the characters for that game. If you choose
the other options, you will be able to build what ever characters you need.
Also keep in mind that the 1st - 4th castles can be in ANY order, but the
above example is best for new players. Here is the reasons for each charatcer
for this example...

Elf      = They can harvest forests, and have good offensive attacks
Clerics  = They have good fighting abilities, and can heal charatcers
Mages    = They have very powerful spells to help destroy enemies
Fighters = They can take out enemies fast, and they are the strongest type
Thieves  = They are best for taking out MEDUSA and can help see farther

As stated before, this is only the best for new players. If you have played
this game before, and understand what you have to do, then you can choose what
ever characters you want, either to test out the characters, or to see if you
can beat the game with those characters.


19.) OKAY, SO NOW I HAVE THIS PARTY STARTED, WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST?
====================================================================
Well, the first thing you should do first is create plots and market places.
You want to start building an income. Farmlands and market places will help. 
Start with farmlands first, they will help build income for a while. Once you 
have a few farmlands, then start building some market places.


20.) WHY DO I NEED TO BUILD MARKET PLACES, THEY DON'T MAKE MUCH INCOME?
=======================================================================
True, but market places increase the farmland values, so you can get more
income from farmlands to. One thing to keep in mind is that after you have
built 10 market places, then that is the highest values the farmlands will 
get. Any more market places will only give 5 more gold of income.


21.) I NOTICE THAT CARTAIN LANDS HAVE CERTAIN COLORS, WHY?
==========================================================
Well, that is for your advantage or disadvantage, depending on where you start
to build things. Building things in certain areas on land could increase or
decrease the effects of what you build.


22.) YOU MEAN I COULD GAIN OR LOSE MONEY DEPENDING ON WHERE I BUILD THINGS?
===========================================================================
Yes. A perfect example is building farmlands on the tan or brown areas. If you
do build farmlands there, you won't get as much as you would from having
farmlands on the green areas, or near/next to water areas.


23.) WHAT CAN I BUILD IN THE TAN OR BROWN AREAS THAT INCREASE INCOME?
=====================================================================
Well, you can't really build anything that will increase income, but if you 
find rocks in those areas, excavate them. By doing so, you have a greater 
chance of finding iron, gold, or gems, And they mostly last longer than if you 
were to find minerals on the green areas of the map.


24.) WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER BUILDINGS, WHERE CAN I PUT THEM?
==========================================================
Anywhere, the rest only effect the characters, abilities, and sometimes the
income you create. Although, if you can build towers, build them on mountains
or higher areas than the green areas. By doing so, you can increase the range
of how far you can see on the map. Of course you have to make sure you have
enough room to build it.


25.) WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE GAME?
==================================================
Getting an income to make money, creating enough farmlands or forests to feed
your characters, making room for each race to build things, building up each
character to make them strong, building inns to help create more characters
as they come, raising the status of your BARON, keeping your STRONGHOLD alive,
and (IF THE GAME SAYS YOU HAVE TO) killing all the enemies in the game.


26.) WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT IS WHAT I NEEDED TO DO?
=============================================================
Because you didn't ask that until now....DUUUUUHHHH.


27.) HOW ABOUT A SMALL REVIEW OF SOME OF THE ENEMIES?
=====================================================
Okay, this is only a small list, I don't want to give EVERYTHING away, or you
may lose the value of this game...

BLAST SPORES = Although rather weak creatures, these are also dangerous to
               face. These creatures float around and have a strange poison
               inside their bodies. If your characters are hit by these
               creatures, your characters have a chance at getting poinsoned.
               If your characters don't get help from being poisoned, your
               characters will disolve and will respawn more SPORES. The only
               way to be cured is to have a cleric near you or head to the
               nearest temple. (Only a cleric race can make temples)

EVIL CHARACTERS = As you know, you can create mages, clerics, fighters, and
                  thieves. Well, you might in fact, run into EVIL versions of
                  these type of characters. Yes, mages and clerics can cast
                  the same type of spells as you can. But the real thing about
                  these characters is that they cannot gain experience, only
                  you can.

GIANT FROGS = Exactly like the name implies, frogs that are of large size.
              These creatures are very annoying to elves, dwarves, and hobits.
              If you have either one of these fighting a giant toad, they may
              be eaten very easily by a toad. These creatures attack by 
              lashing their tongues at the enemy and pulling them into their 
              mouths and, if you are unlucky, eating them.

GIANT SCORPIONS = Exactly like the name implies, scorpions that are of large
                  size. These are very dangerous creatures if confronted. If
                  you do decide to fight these creatures, bring clerics with
                  you, because these scorpions have the ability to poison you
                  with their deadly tail, and if a character gets poisoned,
                  only a cleric can cure them of this. If you do not have
                  clerics in your game, then who ever gets poisoned will die
                  within a few turns.

HARPY = These are very strange creatures. They have wings and claws of a bird,
        but have the upper body of a female. These creatures you have to be
        very careful when you attack. They have the power to charm your
        characters so that your characters attack you instead of the enemy.
        These creatures also fly, so it will be impossible to cast web on
        these creatures.

MEDUSA = Females with snakes as hair on their heads. They wear cloaks to
         conceal their looks from enemies. Be very cautious about these
         creatures, they may look weak, but they can take out even the most
         powerful characters in the game. Only thieves have the real ability
         to take out these deadly creatures, but only if they are equiped with
         mirrors. You see, the MEDUSA'S have a deadly gaze that will turn
         ordinary characters to stone, so only let thieves that have mirrors
         take these out, or you will be fighting a never ending battle.

OBSIDIAN STATUES = These are animated statues made of very strong material 
                   such as obsidian, stone, gems, gold, and other such metals.
                   These creatures can only take damage from enchanted weapons
                   or magic, but cannot be charmed, stoned, or put to sleep.
                   Make sure you have at least 2-3 fighting 1 statue, if not
                   they will take you down fast. These creatures pack quite
                   a punch when they hit you, so be ready for these creatures.

ORCS = Creatures that are cross overs of man and animal. They have character-
       istics of human, but their faces are more of an animal than man. They
       are poor fightes and are easy to take out. Even a small army of
       fighters could take them out.

PURPLE WORMS = These creatures cannot be seen unless you attack them. They
               burrow underground where they can surprize you and attack you
               from anywhere. They are very strong and can take a lot of
               punishment. They also have a nasty bite and can do a lot of
               damage. Make sure you have armies fighting these creatures.

SKELETONS = These are exactly like you see in other RPG type games, creatures
            that have no flesh, but were once human. These are, what's known
            as, animated dead. These creatures are created by a magic force.
            These creatures are mindless, they only attack because that is all
            they know how to do. Although fairly easy to take out, they can
            be annoying.

TROLLS = These are very carniverous creatures. They have human characteristics
         but they like to eat their victims too. Although very easy to take
         out with a good size army, they can also heal themselves while in
         combat, so make sure you take them out fast to make sure you gain
         the upper hand.

WIGHTS = These are another version of undead creatures. They are human, but
         unlike skeletons, they still have most of their flesh on them. Be
         very careful when attacking these creatures. If they do attack you,
         they might drain your characters of experience points if they touch
         you. Meaning, your characters will lose levels and will have to gain
         them back normally again.

There are a lot more monsters to find, but I will let you find out for your-
self who and what they are.


28.) OKAY, WHAT IS THAT BAR AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT THAT APPEARS DURING COMBAT?
===========================================================================
That bar represents both your characters and the enemies chances at combat.
The WHITE part is your bar, the RED is the enemies bar. The more of one of the
colors that shows, the more of a chance that character or group of characters 
has at winning a battle. It's basically a chance bar.


29.) WHAT IS THE HOUR GLASS FOR?
================================
Obviously to show the passage of time. It's also tells when the seasons are
going to change, once the hour glass is empty, a new season will come.


30.) SEASONS, YOU MEAN SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, AND WINTER?
========================================================
Yes, it will change to those seasons. The reason is they wanted to make this
game as real as possible, and they somewhat did. So, not only can you fight
monsters, build castles, build a kingdom, and get income, but you also have
to deal with the harsh elements of the seasons.


31.) WILL THE SEASONS EFFECT ANYTHING I DO?
===========================================
Yes, they effect your crops and food production. During the spring and summer
seasons, crops and trees will produce food at normal outcomes, during the fall
season, crops and trees will increase 25% of normal outcomes, but during the
winter seasons, crops and trees will drop down 75% of normal outcomes. That
is the reason why you would want to make GRANARIES, they will store food for
you so that if your crops can't produce enough food, the GRANARIES will help
feed your characters.


32.) WHAT IS THE BEST THING TO BUILD THAT WILL GENERATE MONEY?
==============================================================
There are 2 things to build that will help create more money. One is an INN.
This will create $25 at first level, $50 when you first upgrade, and $75 on
second upgrage. This also helps increase population at the same time. The
other is a BAZAAR. This helps sell your access food that is not being used.
At first level, it trades 5 food for $5, at first upgrade, it will sell 15
food for $15, and at second upgrade, it will sell 40 food for $40. You can
create as many INNs and BAZAARs as you want, and remember, the more you create
INNs and BAZAARs, the more income you will generate. Keep in mind that you get
that much money PER TURN, not by simply getting the money. Of course farmlands
and trees will create money to, but not as much as INNs and BAZAARs will. Also
remember that you can't build INNs and BAZAARs until you have gained a certain
status in the game.


33.) WHY NOT THE OTHER BUILDINGS THAT GENERATE MONEY?
=====================================================
I know about the other buildings, but they don't generate as much as INNs or
BAZAARs do, those type of buildings only make like $15-$25 PER TURN, a LOT
less than what an INN or BAZAAR would make. And besides, they are sometimes a
lot more expensive than INNs or BAZAARs. Here is a list of the buildings that
do generate money, but not as much as INNs or BAZAARs...

TOY MAKER     = Only ELVES make this
MAGIC MILL    = Only MAGES make this
SCRIBERY      = Only CLERICS make this
GAMBLING HALL = Only THIEVES make this
BREAD SHOP    = Only HOBITS make this

There may be more, but all these, besides INNs and BAZAARs can generate money,
just not as much.


34.) WHAT ABOUT MINES?
======================
Well, yes they do generate money, but eventually, they will run out and you
will have to find another rock which has either iron, gold, or gems. If you
have a DWARF race with you, only have them excavate a rock, because they have
a better chance at finding minerals in rocks and making the mines last
longer so they can get more out of rocks than anyone.


35.) OKAY, DOES THE VAULT (BANK) SERVE A GOOD PURPOSE?
======================================================
Yes, a very good purpose. The vaults are used to store your gold and have a
more readily supply of gold if you make lots of money. After all, castles can
store so much, but a vault will store an extra $50,000 gold to you with max
upgrade per VAULT, if you are making lots of gold. The reason for this is
because there might be a time that you will need to store some money away for
future use and reference. One more thing, the more VAULTS you have, the more
money you can store for yourself.


36.) ABOUT GETTING MORE POPULATION, WHY NOT USE HOUSING?
========================================================
Sure, go ahead if you feel like it, but the reason why you want the INN is
because you can in fact hold more people in INNs than in HOUSING. Plus, you
also get the benefit of getting money from the people who house in the INNS.


37.) SO TELL ME HOW INNS CAN BE BETTER THAN HOUSING?
====================================================
Okay, lets just say you fill one area with HOUSING, and another area with INNs
and check to see what area is getting more people. To help you out, here is a
better way of looking at it. This is a small sample of how ONE AREA can hold
HOUSING, and another holds INNS, this also tells who is better and getting
more people and then some...

AREA 1                        AREA 2
======                        ======
4 houses = 60 people          2 inns = 150 people + 150 gold

As you can see, INNs are the better deal, and as I mentioned, INNs will reap
the people of money so you get an income out of it. Yes INNs area very
expensive, but the income you get from them are worth the price.


38.) OKAY, WHAT ABOUT WEAPONS?
==============================
All characters that you get will have weapons ready for you.


39.) CAN'T I MAKE BETTER WEAPONS THAN THE ONES THEY START OUT?
==============================================================
Yes, of course you can. Everyone, except for mages, can get better weapons
made. To do so, you have to build something for them. Here is a list of what
you need to build for each race, in order to help them get better weapons...

FIGHTERS = Weapon Smith
HOBITS   = Weapon Smith
THIEVES  = Weapon Smith
ELVES    = Fletcher Shop
CLERICS  = Weapon Smith
DWARVES  = Weapon Smith

The reason why MAGES can't build anything that involves weapons is because
they do not use any weapons, they use magic. Keep in mind of course that you
have to upgrade them to make the weapons stronger. Please also remember that
some enemies can't be hurt by normal weapons, you sometimes have to have +1 or
+2 weapons equiped on your characters.


40.) WHAT ABOUT ARMOR, CAN'T THEY INCREASE ARMOR?
=================================================
Only some can, others can't.


41.) WHO CAN BUILD ARMOR SHOPS?
===============================
Here is a list of who can build armories...

FIGHTERS = ARMORY
MAGES    = JEWELER

That's all. Just like the WEAPON SMITHS, you need to upgrade the ARMORIES in
order to get better armor and protection.


42.) WHAT KIND OF SPELLS CAN MAGES AND CLERICS DO?
==================================================
Well, if you want to be more specific on what kind of spells, here is a spell
list for you and it tells what level they will get that spell. Also keep in
mind that elves can cast spells to, so I will include the spell list for them
to...

Mage Spells
===========
Level 1 = CHARM PERSON, MAGIC MISSILE, SLEEP
Level 2 = WEB
Level 3 = FIREBALL, HOLD PERSON, LIGHTNING BOLT
Level 4 = CHARM MONSTER
Level 6 = DEATH SPELL, DISINTIGRATE, FLESH TO STONE
Level 8 = MASS CHARM

Cleric Spells
=============
Level 1 = CURE LIGHT WOUNDS
Level 2 = HOLD PERSON
Level 3 = CURE DISEASE (poisons, stings, etc.)
Level 4 = CURE SERIOUS WOUNDS
Level 5 = CURE CRITICAL WOUNDS, FINGER OF DEATH
Level 6 = CURE ALL

Also keep in mind that the spells affectiveness and strength will increase as
the characters increase in levels. Also keep in mind that elves use the MAGES
spell list, but they gain the spells at a much slower rate of experience.


43.) WHAT ARE ALL THE POSSIBLE PROMOTIONS/STATUS I CAN GAIN?
============================================================
The promotions are as follows, this also includes the status if you are male
or female, this also includes in what order you gain them...

1. Baron/Baroness (Start out as this)
2. Viscount/Viscountess
3. Count/Countess
4. Marquis/Marquise
5. Duke/Duchess
6. Archduke/Archduchess
7. Prince/Princess
8. King/Queen
9. Emperor/Empress


44.) HOW COME I CAN ONLY BUILD SO MANY OUTPOSTS AND ARENAS?
===========================================================
Why would you WANT to build more? Sure, arenas look cool, and help increase
your characters experience, and outposts help keep your characters in one
place so you know where they will go first, but the other reasons are as
follows...

1.) EXPENSIVE
2.) DO NOT INCREASE INCOME
3.) TAKE UP A LOT OF VALUABLE SPACE
4.) THEY HAVE AN UPKEEP COST TO KEEP THEM

Okay, you got 4 reasons that tell you why, as for the actual reason, why would
you need more anyway???


45.) HOW COME I CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE MORE CHARACTERS AS I AM PLAYING?
===================================================================
That's because of the way the game was made. Once there is a certain amount of
characters (INCLUDING ENEMIES), the game will not allow ANYONE to make more
people. So, in order to make more characters, you have to go on a killing
spree and clear up the enemies.


46.) WHY IS IT THAT IT SHOWS I MADE NEW CHARACTERS, BUT I DON'T SEE THEM?
=========================================================================
Read question 45 to find that answer. It's a bug in the game. You may need to
get a patch if that happens.


47.) CAN I GET ANY INFO ABOUT ANYTHING, LIKE HOW MANY BUILDINGS I HAVE?
=======================================================================
Yes, just use your mouse and click on your STRONGHOLD leaders name. Over on
the right hand side of the screen are some buttons to click on. One is called
CENSUS, and another is called PROPERTY. Click on PROPERTY to see all the
buildings you own, and to see how many are at a certain level. Plus, you can
also find out where they are located on a map by clicking on a certain builds
name.


48.) HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM DOING A GOOD JOB AS A LEADER?
========================================================
Well, there are 2 ways. One is to click on your STRONGHOLD leaders name to get
a statistics of your leader. All you have to do is compare the TOP percentage
to the BOTTOM percentage. If the TOP one is higher than the BOTTOM one, then
you are doing a good job. If you are still not sure, then the other way is to
click on your people that is in ANY area. When you do, they will say what the
main problems are, if there are any problems. Keep in mind of course, what
ever race you talk to, they are only referring to THEIR race, not all races.
Some examples include...

("Some say we have enough housing, but try to look for a new place, and you)
(will see how hard it is. We'd be happier if there were more housing."     )

Obviously, they are saying you need more housing for that race.


("We are doing fine now, but what if mines peter out, or monsters attack?)
(We'd be happier if we had more income."                                 )         

This means you need to be making more money. Create more FARMLANDs or INNs.


("Some of the people here are starving, we need more to eat here.")

This means you need to make more farms or get more trees.


These are just a few examples. If they say...

("We are doing well, thank you for all you have done.")

then that means you are doing okay, no need to change anything, but it might
help to plan ahead incase of an emergancy.


49.) WHY IS IT THAT I AM CAUGHT UP, BUT THEY SAY THESE THINGS ANYWAY?
=====================================================================
That's because they are trying to get you to plan ahead. You are right if you
say that they are very personal about certain things, and they are. The game
itself is just trying to get you into the habit of planning ahead. ANY
strategy game will be like that. If you do not plan for the worst at the right
time, you will go down very fast.


50.) DOES IT HELP TO PLAN AHEAD ANYWAY?
=======================================
Yes, as with ANY strategy game, it helps to plan ahead for ANY situation. You
never know if you will run out of food, money, or get attacked. It also helps
to have at least 5-10 characters in every area that has buildings or things
that you own. As long at you check your statistical screen every now and then,
and you make sure to upkeep your food, money and upgrade your buildings as
soon as possible, you will do great in this game.


51.) I NOTICED THAT CERTAIN BUILDINGS TAKE UP A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPACE, WHY?
=============================================================================
Well, it sometimes takes bigger and better buildings to get the bigger and
better jobs done more efficiently. Of course you have small things like farm-
lands, housing, markets, and a few other things.


52.) COULD YOU LIST THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE BIG OR SMALL?
========================================================
Okay, I'll list what are big and small, and will tell you how many sections it
takes to put in that area. (As you might be aware, buildings take up a certain
amount of space in one area. I will give you an example here... ONE AREA HAS
4 SECTIONS, FARMLANDS TAKE UP ONE SECTION, TREES TAKE UP ONE SECTION, INN'S
TAKE UP 2 SECTIONS.)

TYPE            SIZE / HOW MANY SECTIONS IT TAKES UP IN ONE AREA
================================================================
Farmland      = Small / 1
Housing       = Small / 1
Market        = Small / 1
Bridge        = Small / 1
Wall          = Small / 1
Gate          = Small / 1
Tower         = Small / 1
Tree          = Small / 1 (Only Elves can build this, others have to claim)
Armory        = Small / 1 (Only Fighters can build this)
Weaponshop    = Small / 1 (Everyone but Mages and Elves can build this)
Glassworks    = Small / 1 (Only Thieves can build this)
Guardhouse    = Medium/ 2 (Only Fighters can build this)
Fletcher      = Medium/ 2 (Only Elves can build this)
Bread Shop    = Medium/ 2 (Only Hobits/Halfings can build this)
University    = Medium/ 2 (Only Mages can build this)
Mason Hall    = Medium/ 2 (Only Dwarves can build this)
Scribery      = Medium/ 2 (Only Clerics can build this)
Temple        = Medium/ 2 (Only Clerics can build this)
Elf Garden    = Medium/ 2 (Only Elves can build this)
Toy Maker     = Medium/ 2 (Only Elves can build this)
Gambling Hall = Medium/ 2 (Only Thieves can build this)
Builders Hall = Medium/ 2
Vault         = Medium/ 2
INN           = Medium/ 2
Outpost       = Medium/ 2
Castle        = Medium/ 2  (You are allowed to build only 4 max)
Arena         = Large / All 4 sections
Stronghold    = Large / All 4 sections (You are allowed to build only one)

There may be a few more, but you should be able to figure it out anyway.


53.) CAN THE PAUSE BUTTON SERVER A GOOD PERPOSE?
================================================
Yes, in fact, I use the PAUSE button during gameplay a lot so I know what to
do without a pressure from being attacked from enemies or hassled by newly
made characters. Although, if you do want a fast paced game, you can always
let the gameplay run on it's own. The problem with this is it sometimes takes
a while to let time or A TURN pass while the game is going. But, if you're a
person who has to think about what you're doing while playing the game, then
by all means, use the pause ability. Just incase you are wondering, if you
want to let time pass while the game is paused, just press the SPACEBAR while
the PAUSE button is on. Each time you press the SPACEBAR, one turn will pass.


54.) ARE THERE ANY CHEATS TO THIS GAME?
=======================================
It just so happens there is a cheat for this game. This is a MAJOR cheat so if
you use it, it's not my fault if you feel you were ripped off of a game.

Start the game with this command line during DOS prompt, while in the games
directory...

strong debug

This is OBVIOUSLY a debugging commnd line. Now, start a game, or load a saved
game, and while in a game, hold the ALT key, then press one of the following
keys for that cheat...

B = Allows you to change ANYONES buildings to what ever you want. You must
    first be in an area that has a character on screen, and they must have a
    building of some type, second from the left. You can only change a
    building if there IS a building already. This also includes rocks, trees,
    ruins, swamp, and a lot more, but there MUST be something and YOU or THEY
    must own it.

C = Changes ANYONE to any creature or character you want in that area. Keep in
    mind that you cannot control monsters if you change one of your characters
    in the game. Also remember, if you do change one of YOUR characters to a
    monster, the new monster will have the hit points of the character you
    changed.

D = Shows where all the characters are when you go to that area. MAP MODE.

F = Similar to the B cheat.

G = This will end the game with you as the loser, get to see the bad ending.

H = This shows the string or HEX it uses for that area of the map. 

J = All castles will gain 5-20 new troops, instead of waiting for troops. This
    will also allow the enemies to gain this much at the same time.

K = Instantly destroy an enemy stronghold or castle. Be prepared to fight ANY
    monsters that were left if there was any monsters left of that castle.

L = Raise levels for one character, but you can have multiple high level
    characters. To do this, first, go to an area that has your characters
    there. Then, use the cheat to raise the level until it says 36. You can
    go higher, but the charatcers will only go up to 36. Now, click on your 
    character in that area. That character from now on will be level 36. Now, 
    do it again for another character. After a while, you will have lots of 
    your people who will be level 36. You will have to leave the area, then
    come back to see the changes of the character, but this will work. CAUTION
    THIS CHEAT WILL ALSO WORK ON ENEMIES, THEY WON'T BE ANY STRONGER, BUT THEY
    WILL HAVE HIGHER OR LOWER HIT POINTS IF YOU TRY THIS.

M = DO NOT USE THIS CHEAT, THIS WILL DO SOMETHING YOU WILL NOT LIKE! IF YOU
    USE THIS CHEAT, I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR "ANY" DAMAGE THAT IS
    CAUSED BY THIS CHEAT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. (Relax, it's not a virus)

P = BARON will gain a status like DUKE, or PRINCE or something like that. He
    or she will gain NEXT status.

Q = Press this a few times and the land near you will be covered with ruins.

R = You will become EMPEROR/EMPRESS instantly when you use this.

S = Change the season to the season you like best.

Y = Kills 1 of ANYONE that is in that area. Sometimes will respawn.

Z = Hurts ALL MONSTERS that are in that area. If you have your characters in
    that area, only the monsters will take damage. Sometimes will respawn.
